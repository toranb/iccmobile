One time security reviews just prior to release and static code analysis don't catch all critical vulnerabilities. Capturing them on a continuous basis as code is written is a better approach. I will focus on incorporating tools to automate enforcing security concerns into Agile software processes.\r\n\r\nWorldwide, from government to retail, banking to healthcare, hacks and data breaches are becoming household names. Yet software teams often ignore many security concerns as they work towards their various delivery deadlines, handling only those that are easy to incorporate. And teams generally rely on manual processes to ensure that even these steps are followed.\r\n\r\nToday, Agile is more than a buzzword; it?s the new norm. Its adoption is widespread and there are conferences and books dedicated to the practice. It?s known for bringing testing into focus as something that should be done throughout the delivery process instead of just at the end.\r\n\r\nTaking the same approach for security is a logical next step in advancing our craft. By including various security checks in our Continuous Delivery practices we can ensure that we are thinking about building secure applications from the start rather than waiting until the end, doing some ad hoc testing, and praying that we are not the headline of the next large breach.\r\n\r\nThis talk will go through a few options, using examples for multiple programming languages including C#, Java, and Ruby and highlighting how running them regular could thwart various security threats.&quot;,&quot;room&quot;:&quot;Prairie.Code() - Room 1&quot;,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;web&quot;:&quot;http://jemappellewendyi.com&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Chicago, IL&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Wendy Istvanick&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Wendy has been a developer with ThoughtWorks for over 20 years and has enjoyed solving technical problems and making people happy along the way. She also loves to travel. So life as a consultant has been great, giving her many chances to enable solutions while living in places she never would have dreamed of living while growing up, including Brazil, France, India, and Zambia.\r\n\r\nIn addition to coding on many projects she has had the opportunity to facilitate training both internal to ThoughtWorks and at client sites over the years thus being able to share her craft with others. Most recently this includes delivering application security training to consultants around the globe, including trainer other trainers to deliver the same material.&quot;,&quot;img&quot;:null}},{&quot;session&quot;:&quot;From Legacy MVC to Modern MVC: An ASP.NET Core Migration Path&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;9:00 AM - 10:15 AM&quot;,&quot;desc&quot;:&quot;With all the buzz around Microsoft's revitalized ASP.NET MVC Core framework, you may wonder what has changed since your \&quot;legacy\&quot; ASP.NET MVC application was written. Sure, there are new framework features and development tools available; but, which of these things are actually worth adopting and when? Should I stick with ASP.NET Web Optimization for bundling &amp; minification, or should I use Gulp? What's the difference between a tag helper and an HTML helper? Which package manager(s) should I use to acquire the requisite bits and assets? How does the framework support dependency injection for my controllers? Should I target .NET Framework, .NET Core, or both? Lend me 60 minutes of your time, and I'll answer these and some other frequently asked questions.

If so, this talk is for you.  \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I?ll work from several example code segments and show how to recognize which design pattern would be appropriate.  I?ll then show how to refactor the existing code to use the chosen design pattern and demonstrate how the resulting code is more understandable, easier to maintain and easier to test.\r\n\r\nAmong the examples I will show is how a dependency on an external system can be refactored using an interface and applying the bridge and adapter pattern. I?ll also show how to use the decorator pattern to cache results from an external call.  Finally, I?ll show examples of how patterns like the strategy pattern and chain of responsibility pattern can replace large blocks of if/else if statements to create a simpler design that is easier to test.\r\n\r\nWhen this talk is complete, you will have a good idea of how to recognize where these patterns can be applied in your code base and how you go about implementing them.&quot;,&quot;room&quot;:&quot;Room 4&quot;,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;web&quot;:&quot;http://buildingbettersoftware.blogspot.com/&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Appleton, WI&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;David Berry&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;I'm a Solutions Architect with over 20 years of experience in building software systems.

In this talk we?ll cover some of the low hanging fruit within the Azure platform, including Web Apps (App Services), Web Jobs, and Message Queues, and demonstrate how easy it can be to start designing for the Cloud, and better utilize the tools available.\r\n\r\nWe'll start from `File > New Project` and have a solution designed for the cloud, written and deployed to Azure, within the first 30 minutes.&quot;,&quot;room&quot;:&quot;Room 2&quot;,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;web&quot;:&quot;http://stonefinch.com/&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Des Moines, Iowa&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Aaron Hoffman&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Aaron is the co-founder of Stonefinch, an Agile Development and Data Analytics Consultancy based in Des Moines, Iowa.

Out with the kitchen sink that is the System.Web assembly, and in with the new. Couple this with a lightweight, cross-platform code editor which comprehends ASP.NET Core 1.0, and developers around the world rejoice. So let?s dive in! Open Visual Studio Code, and choose File -> New -> Project, right? Not quite! This talk will explore how to get started with ASP.NET Core 1.0, from the ground up, using Visual Studio Code. Along the way, we?ll discuss new features and how to take advantage of them in your applications.&quot;,&quot;room&quot;:&quot;Room 3&quot;,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;web&quot;:&quot;https://scottaddie.com/&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Madison, WI&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Scott Addie&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Scott Addie is a Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer (Web Applications), a Microsoft MVP (Visual Studio and Development Technologies), and a .NET Solutions Architect with CUNA Mutual Group in Madison, WI.

A developer can be staring at the weirdest issue ever with no clue where to begin troubleshooting. Sometimes, searching Stack Overflow for related issues can feel like an exercise in futility.  A developer?s mettle can be tested when this happens, so having the right tools and the proper mindset can mean the difference between a five minute fix, and an all-nighter. This presentation will reveal some troubleshooting tools and tips that a developer can start implementing to help fix issues before they bring the development team to a grinding halt.&quot;,&quot;room&quot;:&quot;Room 4&quot;,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;web&quot;:&quot;http://ryandoll.com&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Lenexa, KS&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Ryan Doll&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Ryan brings more than 11 years of development experience across multiple technologies at VML.

They're not fun to write, they can break if your implementation changes, sometimes they're hard to write, or it can not even test anything at all. What if we could test our code based on business requirements instead? In this talk, we'll go over Behat, a PHP behavior driven test tool that allows us to do just that.&quot;,&quot;room&quot;:&quot;Room 5&quot;,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;web&quot;:&quot;http://mlo.io&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Fort Collins, CO&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Matthew Loberg&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;With a varied background in PHP, Python, Ruby, and DevOps Matt has had a lot of experience in his 6 years in the software world.

While Visual Studio remains king of .NET development, modern web interfaces have shifted away from server-generated HTML and into JavaScript libraries like Angular, Ember, or React. The days of tightly-coupled server-client web frameworks are fading. Break your Web UIs out of Visual Studio; make them the isolated, testable, first-class citizens they should be, just like you would do for your Android and iOS applications. Learn how to create powerful, rich web interfaces using the right tools for the job while retaining server-side logic in the languages you know.&quot;,&quot;room&quot;:&quot;Room 2&quot;,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;web&quot;:&quot;http://www.aranasoft.com&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;St. Louis MO&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Jeff Strauss&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Jeff is both a software consultant and a licensed attorney.

Plugins and Themes take care of most of the work, but what about the inevitable necessity to make code changes?  For new developers, or developers more familiar with other environments, setting up a clean development workspace for this task may seem overwhelming.\r\n\r\nIn this discussion we will cover simple development workflows and readily available tools that will level up your professionalism and increase your effectiveness with your future WordPress development.&quot;,&quot;room&quot;:&quot;Room 3&quot;,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;web&quot;:&quot;https://dakotasoftworks.com&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Cedar Rapids, IA&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Seth Adam&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Seth Adam is principal and founder of Dakota Softworks, LLC, a custom software development firm in Cedar Rapids, IA.

Sounds too good to be true, but it?s not completely false. AWS Lambda is a new hosting style that provides some unique benefits and challenges. If you?ve never heard of AWS Lambda or even ever messed with AWS at all this might be the talk for you. I?ll go over what Lambda is, why I think it could be useful in some cases, where I think it?s challenging, and some other fun things that come along with it.&quot;,&quot;room&quot;:&quot;Room 4&quot;,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;web&quot;:&quot;http://chuckrolek.com&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Des Moines&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Chuck Rolek&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Fueled by silliness and coffee I try to create efficiency in everything I and others do.
