Have you ever wondered how applications that do this accomplish it? Have you ever been sitting around with too much time on your hands and needed something interesting to think about? If so, then this talk is for you. During this talk we'll look at an app with a simple, easy to Grok API, and build up our own scripting language using the ANTLR4 Parser/Lexer generator, with which to drive it.

As the use of smartphones and their onscreen keyboards has flourished, however, inputs have taken on a new and incredibly important role - but they're also riddled with browser and device inconsistencies. Learn how input types and patterns can give your users a better onscreen keyboard experience, and how to abuse these features to meet the needs of today (if you must).","room":"Room 113","speaker":{"web":"aaronladage.com","location":"Overland Park, KS","name":"Aaron Ladage","bio":"Aaron Ladage is a Senior UI engineer at DEG in Kansas City.

Statistical transformations may be applied and the plot can be drawn on a specific coordinate system. A plot can be repeated for subsets of the data using facetting. Sophisticated graphics can be built up in layers, combining multiple data sets if desired. Themes can be used to control things like font size and background color.\n\nMuch of the power of ggplot2 comes from the fact that it is based on coherent set of principles. Although this means there is a bit of a learning curve, ggplot2 is not going to get you 90% of the way to your desired graphic and leave you frustrated that there is no way to achieve what you really want.\n\nBasic knowledge of R will be assumed but not absolutely required. You'll come away with a basic understanding of how to create data visualizations using ggplot2.\n","room":"Room 108 (Scooter Software)","speaker":{"web":"www.bigcreek.com","location":"Polk City, IA","name":"David W.

You have created amazing business applications (or) you start a new line of business application by creating a new project in Visual Studio. 90% of the time, it will default to WinForms or WPF. Why move your line of business apps and re-write them as universal apps? This is not necessary. We will show you how to bring your app to Windows App Store and add all the new bells and whistles. We will teach your app new tricks. Your app is not dead. You do not need to move over from your old code. Bring your existing apps that you want to see in the App Store and we will roll up our sleeves and have your app shine as new Universal Apps by using the Desktop Bridge. Takeaways: 1.

That new piece of shiny code you just wrote with a hundred percent test coverage goes ka-put once it's deployed once deployed there. What broken, and why? Sometimes the errors are a little more subtle, lying and growing there until you reach the right conditions. Either way, when users experience problems, it's not good. \n\nMaybe we need to check our assumptions a bit and figure out how to lower the risk if things go sideways.
